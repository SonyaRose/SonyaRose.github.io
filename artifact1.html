            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                This artifact is a C++ program originally developed as part of a Secure Coding course. The purpose of
                the program is to safely test numeric overflow and underflow across a wide range of C++ data types,
                including signed integers, unsigned integers, and floating-point types.
            </p>

            <p>
                The original version of the program used template functions to repeatedly add or subtract values near
                the numeric limits of each data type. Before performing each operation, the code checked whether the
                next calculation would exceed the maximum or minimum value for that type. When a potential overflow or
                underflow was detected, the program printed a warning message to the console and stopped further
                processing for that test case.
            </p>

            <p>
                This artifact demonstrates foundational secure coding concepts by proactively detecting unsafe numeric
                operations rather than allowing undefined or dangerous behavior to occur.

            <div class="enhancement-box">
                <h4>Key Issues Identified:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tight Coupling:</strong> Overflow detection logic was directly coupled to console output
                        through print statements</li>
                    <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Functions simply printed messages and returned values instead
                        of properly signaling errors</li>
                    <li><strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> Arithmetic logic and user output were tightly coupled
                        and core functions both detected errors and printed messages</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing Feedback:</strong> Test results required manual review of console output and
                        there was no automated indication of success or failures</li>
                    <li><strong>Code Structure:</strong> Calculation logic mixed with UI presentation concerns</li>
                    <li><strong>Modern C++ Practices:</strong> Runtime type checks were used where compile-time checks
                        could improve clarity and efficiency</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Enhancements Implemented</h3>
            
            <h4>1. Structured Error Handling with Custom Exceptions</h4>
            <p>
              A custom <span class="code-highlight">NumericOverflowException</span> was introduced to replace
              console-only error reporting.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Overflow and underflow conditions now throw exceptions</li>
              <li>Errors can no longer be silently ignored</li>
              <li>Calling code can explicitly handle failure scenarios</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This change improves reliability, security, and professional coding practices.</p>

            <h4>2. Separation of Logic and Output</h4>
            <p>
              Arithmetic functions were refactored to focus solely on computation and validation.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Core logic detects unsafe conditions and throws exceptions</li>
              <li>Test functions are responsible for output and reporting</li>
              <li>Improves modularity and reusability</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Automated Test Result Tracking</h4>
            <p>
              Success and failure counters were added to the test runners.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Each test case records whether it passed or failed</li>
              <li>Final summaries display clear test results</li>
              <li>Reduces reliance on manual output inspection</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4. Modern C++ Compile-Time Type Checking</h4>
            <p>
              Replaced runtime checks with <span class="code-highlight">if constexpr</span> and <span
                class="code-highlight">std::is_integral_v&lt;T&gt;</span>.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Type-specific logic resolved at compile time</li>
              <li>Cleaner, safer, and more efficient code</li>

                    <h3>Narrative Reflection</h3>
                    <p>
                        The artifact I selected for this milestone is a program that I originally created during my Secure
                        Coding course. The purpose of the original assignment was to explore how different C++ data types
                        behave when pushed to their numeric limits. The program uses templates to test multiple primitive
                        types and observes whether overflow or underflow occurs during repeated addition or subtraction. I
                        chose this artifact because it represents foundational C++ concepts with templates, type traits,
                        numeric limits, and highlights the importance of defensive programming, which is something I knew I
                        could expand and refine for my ePortfolio.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I included this artifact because it gave me a strong opportunity to demonstrate software engineering
                        and secure coding practices. The original version of the program worked, but it handled errors in a
                        very informal way: it printed messages directly from the core logic and returned early whenever
                        overflow was detected. To improve the quality of the program, I redesigned how the logic reports
                        unsafe operations by creating a custom exception type, <span
                            class="code-highlight">NumericOverflowException</span>. Instead of printing messages inside the
                        numeric functions, the program now throws structured exceptions that the test harness can catch and
                        respond to. I also modernized the type-checking logic by replacing runtime if statements with
                        C++17's <span class="code-highlight">if constexpr</span> pattern, which allows compile-time
                        branching based on whether a type is integral. Finally, I added automated pass/fail tracking so the
                        program now produces a clear summary of how many operations succeeded and how many failed. These
                        enhancements showcase my skills in clean code design, modern C++ practices, exception handling, and
                        structured testing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In Module One, I planned for this artifact to demonstrate primarily Outcome 3 (design and evaluate
                        computing solutions) and Outcome 5 (develop a security mindset). I believe I fully met those goals.
                        The new exception-based error handling shows a clear security mindset by ensuring that unsafe
                        numeric behavior cannot be ignored by callers. The improved structure and separation of
                        concerns—moving print statements out of the core logic—also demonstrates thoughtful software design
                        and aligns strongly with Outcome 3. The addition of patterned test summaries also helps me better
                        meet Outcome 2, because the output is now cleaner and easier for a user or reviewer to understand.
                        Overall, the enhancements strengthened my alignment with multiple outcomes more than I originally
                        anticipated.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Enhancing this artifact taught me a lot about how small architectural decisions can affect the
                        clarity and safety of a program. I learned how powerful exception handling can be when used
                        correctly, and how separating "logic" from "reporting" makes code easier to maintain and test. I
                        also gained experience modernizing older C++ patterns with features like <span
                            class="code-highlight">if constexpr</span>, which helped me think more critically about
                        compile-time vs. runtime decisions. One challenge I faced during the enhancement was balancing
                        accuracy with readability, especially when handling floating-point overflow, which behaves
                        differently than integral overflow. Another challenge was making sure the enhancements stayed true
                        to the original purpose of the program, without over-engineering it. In the end, the process made me
                        more confident in applying secure coding principles and taught me how to improve a program's
                        testability without changing its core functionality.
