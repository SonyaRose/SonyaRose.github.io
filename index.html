      <div class="self-assessment-content">
        <h3>Self-Assessment</h3>
        <p>Completing the Computer Science program and developing this ePortfolio has given me the opportunity to step
          back and reflect on how my skills, mindset, and professional goals have evolved. Throughout the program, I
          gained not only technical knowledge, but also a clearer understanding of how to apply that knowledge in a
          realistic and industry-aligned context. Building this portfolio allowed me to intentionally showcase my
          strengths, demonstrate growth across multiple areas of computer science, and present my work in a way that
          reflects how I would approach real-world software development challenges.</p>

        <p>One of the most valuable outcomes of my coursework was learning how to collaborate effectively and
          communicate clearly within technical environments. While many of my projects were completed independently,
          collaboration was still central, through discussion boards, or responding to instructor and rubric feedback. I
          learned to explain technical decisions in plain language, justify design choices, and adapt my work based on
          critique. These experiences helped me become more comfortable communicating with both technical and
          non-technical stakeholders, a skill that is incredibly important in professional software development roles.
        </p>

        <p>As the program progressed, my confidence in data structures and algorithms grew significantly. Early projects
          focused on correctness and basic functionality, but later coursework challenged me to think more deeply about
          efficiency, scalability, and trade-offs. I learned how to evaluate which data structures best fit a problem,
          analyze time and space complexity, and refactor existing solutions to improve performance without breaking
          functionality. This shift from simply making code work, to making it work well, has been one of the most
          important developments in my problem-solving approach.</p>

        <p>The program also strengthened my foundation in software engineering and database design. I gained experience
          writing modular, maintainable code, applying validation consistently, and refactoring systems while preserving
          backward compatibility. Moving from in-memory data storage to a persistent database environment reinforced the
          importance of clean data models, separation of concerns, and reliable testing strategies. Working with
          databases helped me understand how application logic and data persistence interact in real systems, and how
          design decisions at the data layer impact scalability, reliability, and maintainability.</p>

        <p>Security awareness was another key theme woven throughout my coursework. Rather than treating security as an
          afterthought, I learned to consider validation, data integrity, and error handling as part of secure design.
          Whether validating user input, preventing invalid state transitions, or managing database interactions safely,
          I developed a mindset focused on anticipating misuse and reducing risk. This security-conscious approach
          influences how I design and evaluate software solutions, and helped me greatly in my current career.</p>

        <p>The artifacts included in this ePortfolio work together to represent this progression. Each artifact
          highlights a different aspect of my development, ranging from algorithmic decision-making, to database
          integration, to testing and validation, but they are all connected by a consistent emphasis on clarity,
          correctness, and thoughtful design. Together, they demonstrate my ability to analyze existing systems,
          identify meaningful improvements, implement enhancements responsibly, and communicate technical work
          effectively.</p>

        <p>Overall, completing this program and assembling this ePortfolio has prepared me to enter the computer science
          field with confidence. I now approach problems with a stronger technical foundation, a clearer professional
          identity, and a mindset focused on continuous improvement. This portfolio reflects not just what I have built,
          but how I think as a computer scientist, and it serves as a foundation I can continue to build upon as I grow
          in my career.</p>
